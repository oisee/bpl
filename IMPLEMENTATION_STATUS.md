# BPL Parser Connectivity Implementation Status

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Documentation âœ…
- Created comprehensive `CONNECTIVITY_GUIDE.md` documenting the correct connectivity model
- Established clear principles: implicit sequential flow + explicit arrow connections
- Documented all connection patterns including FQN, cross-lane, and complex flows

### 2. Test Suite âœ…
- Created `test-connectivity.js` with 11 comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Basic sequential flow
  - Cross-lane connections
  - Explicit arrows (-> and <-)
  - Chained connections
  - Complex multi-path flows
  - Connection breaks
  - Gateway handling
  - Message flows

### 3. Parser Implementation ğŸš§
- Added new connectivity methods to `BpmnLiteParser`:
  - `connectTasks()` - main orchestrator
  - `buildGlobalTaskOrder()` - creates sequential task list
  - `createImplicitConnections()` - handles default flow
  - `processExplicitArrowConnections()` - handles arrows
  - `parseArrowConnections()` - parses arrow syntax
  - `handleSpecialConnections()` - gateways and events

## Current Status

The parser has been updated with the correct connectivity logic following our guide. The implementation includes:

1. **Global Task Order**: Tasks are processed in document order, regardless of lanes
2. **Implicit Connections**: Sequential tasks connect automatically across lanes
3. **Explicit Arrows**: Additional connections via -> and <- operators
4. **Proper Resolution**: Support for FQN (@Lane.Task) references
5. **Connection Breaks**: Respect for --- separators

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Open `dist/index.html` in a browser
3. The test results will appear in the console and status panel

## Expected Test Results

When fully working, all 11 tests should pass with:
- Correct number of connections
- No missing connections
- No extra connections

## Next Steps

1. Debug any remaining connection logic issues
2. Ensure arrow parsing handles all edge cases
3. Verify gateway branch handling
4. Test with real-world BPMN diagrams
