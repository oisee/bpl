Purpose
-------

This project implements a minimal, intuitive domain-specific language (DSL) called
BPMN-lite for describing business process diagrams. The DSL source can be
parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and rendered as Mermaid flowcharts.

Key features:
  * Whitespace-insensitive syntax with simple line-based parsing
  * Support for tasks, gateways, message flows, data objects, lanes/pools, and annotations
  * Explicit and implicit connections (->, <-, sequential flows)
  * AST preview and name normalization
  * Export into multiple formats:
    - .bpl (source code)
    - .json (AST representation)
    - .mmd (Mermaid diagram)
    - .xlsx (Visio-compatible Excel)
  * Available as a web editor and as a portable desktop application

By providing a streamlined workflow from DSL authoring to diagram export and
integration with Visio, this tool enables both technical and non-technical users
to author, visualize, and exchange process models efficiently.
